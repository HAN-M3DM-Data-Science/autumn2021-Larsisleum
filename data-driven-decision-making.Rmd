## Why was data driven decision making (3DM) useful in this business case?
Within Hello Fresh 3DM is being used all through the company. One of the most widely used data analytics is tracking market trends. For instance, Hello Fresh makes data-driven decisions based on market trends by harnessing Google’s keyword planner to analyze trends in searches at specific periods of time. They also perform data analyses on dishes people eat at restaurants. Hello Fresh is identifying the season’s demand through customer data, which can include for instance knowledge of customers’ celebration of certain religious observances or cultural festivals. For example, Hello Fresh uses data analytics together with knowledge of holidays like Thanksgiving Day to prepare turkey and pumpkin related recipes.
Data analytics is also used to ensure that the MPS’s offerings are aligned with customers' seasonal demands. This process involves understanding what food dishes are popular during a specific season and, based on analytics, suitable dishes are then created and served to customers during that time period. Another use of 3DM is the weekly demand forecasting that aims to reduce over- and underpreperation of food as much as possible. The preperation of the amount of food needs to be just in balance so the customer is happy with the amount of food but also doesn't get too much food so it goes to waste. 

## How did the organization apply 3DM?
First they noticed a knowlage gap within the company about data driven decisionmaking. Which they worked on by implementing a comprehensive data literacy program internally and hiring new people with the right skillsets. 

They also made a standardized implementing proces of new experiments that tests a new DDDM tool or idea. This cicle can be seen in the image below:

## What can the organization do with 3DM that they couldn’t do before?
They have a better way of getting to know their customer by constantly collecting and analysing their data. Predictive capabilities around the ideal quantities to produce and food trends in general.
